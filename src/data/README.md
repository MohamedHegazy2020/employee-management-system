## üîß Usage in Stores

### Companies Store

```typescript
import { companiesData, type Company } from "@/data";

// Load data
companies.value = companiesData.companies;
```

### Employees Store

```typescript
import { employeesData, type Employee } from "@/data";

// Load data
employees.value = employeesData.employees;
```

### Departments Store

```typescript
import { departmentsData, type Department } from "@/data";

// Load data
departments.value = departmentsData.departments;
```

### Auth Store

```typescript
import { usersData, type User } from "@/data";

// Find user for authentication
const foundUser = usersData.users.find(
  (u) => u.email === credentials.email && u.password === credentials.password
);
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Recommendations

1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords should be hashed using bcrypt or similar
2. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data should be moved to environment variables
3. **API Integration**: Replace JSON files with actual API calls
4. **Data Validation**: Implement proper data validation
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper role-based access control

### Development Notes

- Current passwords are plain text for development purposes
- All data is stored in JSON files for easy development and testing
- Data can be easily modified for testing different scenarios

## üìù Data Management

### Adding New Data

1. Add new entries to the appropriate JSON file
2. Ensure all required fields are provided
3. Maintain data consistency across related entities
4. Update this documentation if schema changes

### Data Validation

- All IDs should be unique within their respective collections
- Foreign key references should be valid
- Date formats should be consistent (ISO 8601)
- Required fields should not be null or empty

### Data Migration

When moving to production:

1. Export JSON data to database
2. Implement proper data validation
3. Set up data backup and recovery procedures
4. Implement data versioning if needed

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Data Versioning**: Track changes to data over time
- **Data Export**: Export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- **Data Import**: Import data from external sources
- **Data Analytics**: Advanced reporting and analytics
- **Real-time Sync**: Real-time data synchronization
- **Data Backup**: Automated backup and recovery

### Scalability Considerations

- **Database Migration**: Move from JSON to proper database
- **Caching**: Implement data caching for better performance
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets efficiently
- **Search**: Implement advanced search functionality
- **Filtering**: Add more sophisticated filtering options
